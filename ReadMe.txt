1. The application is developed using .NET core MVC and Entity framework Core SqlLite.
2. One test user with username: test, password: pwd123
3. JWT tokens are used for authentication.
4. MVC is mainly used for serving the HTML, client-side logic has been written in Javascript, and API calls are made using Ajax.
5. Repository pattern is used to create a generic repository for data access.

Anything extra you would have done given more time
 1. Not a proper single page application.
 2. Proper exception handling and logging needs to be added.
 3. Proper data validation mechanisms (like a validation filter) can be added.
 4. Stored the plain password ,no hashing is used.
